My solution to the "rainwater trapping" algorithm problem.

There are two implementations in the lib directory:

1. rainwater_trapping.rb is my solution
  - O(n), with a fairly good constant in the range of 0.5 - 1

2. rainwater_trapping_2.rb is another solution I found online and decided to implement myself for understanding.
  - O(n), with a constant of 4

The spec directory has rspec tests with guard to test these (and any other) implementation.
